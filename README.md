# Amazon Kindle Price Scraper

I want to buy a black, ad-supported [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Now-with-Built-in-Front-Light/dp/B07978J597/) as a present for Christmas â€” but only when its price drops after the holidays. I wrote a scraper to log the price every 5 hours, and send [me](https://twitter.com/aadittambe) an email notification when the price drops.
